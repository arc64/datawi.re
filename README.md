Explain it to me, I'm a normal person: I want to be able to reduce the amount of manual labour
in keeping track of developments in different areas of expertise. I don't want to look at
that PDF every week. I don't want to waste hours in a week checking this data against that data.

Explain it to me, I'm a developer: You can create a feed service and push messages to the 
service. Messages have a metadata envelope and the actual data contained within a record
of the data source that you're providing. 

You can also write processing stages, such as geo-coders, company register lookups, 
value normalisation or named entity extraction. 

Even more, you can code event handlers which get triggered by matching filters and then 
take some action, such as notifying a user via email, a text message or by sending an 
automated killer drone which then eradicates a medium-sized village. We're hoping for 
good data quality on the last one.
