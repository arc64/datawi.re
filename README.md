datawi.re - flowing data, hidden story
--------------------------------------

Optional: talk to some journalists. 

What tasks would this help with? 

* Keeping an eye on...
*  ... parliaments, 
*  ... procurement, 
*  ... grants,
*  ... air traffic, 
*  ... scientific research publications, 
*  ... patent applications,
*  ... crime and punishment,
*  ... obituaries,
*  ... gas prices,
*  ... movie release dates,
*  ... the sky,
*  ... the volcano,
*  ... lobbyists signing up to a register,
*  ... company statements coming out,
*  ... changes in company ownership,
*  ... local elections,
*  ... food prices, commodity prices, harvests.


Explain it to me, I'm a normal person: I want to be able to reduce the amount of manual labour
in keeping track of developments in different areas of expertise. I don't want to look at
that PDF every week. I don't want to waste hours in a week checking this data against that data.

Explain it to me, I'm a developer: You can create a feed service and push messages to the 
service. Messages have a metadata envelope and the actual data contained within a record
of the data source that you're providing. 

You can also write processing stages, such as geo-coders, company register lookups, 
value normalisation or named entity extraction. 

Even more, you can code event handlers which get triggered by matching filters and then 
take some action, such as notifying a user via email, a text message or by sending an 
automated killer drone which then eradicates a medium-sized village. We're hoping for 
good data quality on the last one. 


Revised pitch
-------------

* datawi.re is a streaming service for monitoring misc data feeds.
* datawi.re is just another thing you connect your scrapers to, allows for quick and simple submission of a data frame. 
* datawi.re has a twitter-like UI. each service defines a template with which a data frame is rendered.
* instead of following a user or a hashtag, you follow search terms by adding them to one of your four watchlists.
