<h1>A Wire Service for Data</h1>

<p>
    datawi.re helps you to stay informed about people, organisations and
    topics that you are interested in by monitoring data feeds of
    government [and businesses].
</p>

<p>
    Automatically keep track a range of data sources and be informed whenever
    an action &mdash; a government contract, company registration, or
    criminal arrest &mdash; mentions the name of one of the topics of your 
    investigations.
</p>

<p>
    Our service is powered by a decentralized network of data stringers,
    small tools that monitor data feeds and submit new records to datawi.re 
    where they'll be matched to the names of people, organizations, 
    topics and places that you've set up to monitor.
