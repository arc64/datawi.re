<h2>Getting in touch</h2>

<p>We're keen to hear from you - whether you have a question, suggestion, 
comment or you'd like to contribute to the site. Please note, however, that
datawi.re is a part-time project and that it may take us a bit longer to
get back to you than you'd expect from a commercial service.</p>

<p>datawi.re is a project of some of the 2013 Knight-Mozilla OpenNews Fellows.
The OpenNews programme supports the development of news technology through 
hackdays, coding sprints and by embedding technologists into news
organizations. Fellows develop tools that benefit both their host company
and the wider ecosystem of open-source news technologies.</p>

<p>If you'd like to find out more, also consider joining our mailing list 
and bi-weekly community calls.</p>
