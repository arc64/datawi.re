<h2>Privacy and Data Protection</h2>

<p>datawi.re stores some of your private information, including (depending on
  your authentication method) your name, nickname and email address. We
  further retain OAuth credentials from Facebook and Twitter for the duration
  of your session. These credentials enable us to read further profile
  information as provided by Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>While our API grants public access to a list of users, including their name
  and email address, we will of course not share your OAuth credentials. We 
  reserve the right to share your email address with third parties in order
  for them to develop notification and data analysis services based on your 
  stream.</p>

<p>We also reserve the right to send you email. While most of these will be 
  notifications about new data matches, we would also like to include the 
  occasional feature announcement. We promise not to over-do it and that 
  we won't spam.</p>

<p>We realize that for journalists and researchers, sharing lists of people,
  organizations, topics and places that they are interested in is a sensistive
  proposition. We will handle this data as safely as possible. Specifically, 
  we will not share your entity lists with other users or third parties unless
  you explicitly authorize us to do so.</p>

<p>However, we do reserve the right to
  datamine your watchlists to improve our service. We also reserve the right
  to publish aggregates and use the entity names you have specified for 
  platform functionality such as autocompletion.</p>

<h3>Account removal</h3>

<p>Due to its early stage of development, datawi.re doesn't support the
  complete removal of user profiles at the moment. If you would still like 
  to delete your account, please email us. We are sorry for this
  inconvenience.</p>
