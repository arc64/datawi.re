<h2>Contributing to datawi.re</h2>

<p>We'd love to see contributions to datawi.re, so that the site can become 
more useful to you. Here's some of the types of contributions we're most
keen for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Give feedback and tell others.</strong> As datawi.re is an experiment, we're looking
  to get a wide range of opinions on the service. Please also help us to 
  spread the word and invite others to use the service.</li>

<li><strong>Add new data feeds.</strong> datawi.re can only be as good as the data which it
  monitors, so if you operate a data feed - such as a scraper for a public
  data source - please consider submitting data from this feed to datawi.re.</li>

<li><strong>Contribute to the core software.</strong> This could include extensions to the
  user interface, but also more intelligent systems for matching search
  terms with data and external services which execute actions based on
  matches.</li>

<li><strong>Embed a data feed.</strong> We're hoping to offer support for embeddable activity
  streams soon. If you want to embed a feed of information relating to 
  a specific company, person or topic on your own web site, please help
  us design this function.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Which kinds of data feeds are you looking for?</h3>

<p>datawi.re is focussed on transactional data, in particular data about 
interactions between people, companies, public bodies or specific 
topics. Government spending and revenue, lobbying activity, legislative
activity and official journals are good examples of the types of
information most relevant to this service.</p>

<p>We aim to respect individual privacy and data feeds which contain personal
information without reflecting a public interest (such as government
action, policy formation or actions of public companies) will not be
considered.</p>

<h3>How do I add a data feed?</h3>

<p>Adding a data feed to datawi.re requires three steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Coding or extending a script or application to submit data records 
  (called "frames") to datawi.re. This can just mean extending an
  existing web scraper or ETL process, but it could also be a new
  application that submits individual frames to the datawi.re
  servers. If you're using Python, please use the [datastringer]
  client library. For other languages, please refer to the [REST API
  documentation].</li>

    <li>Writing a service profile to describe the way in which data should
  be represented in the user interface. Each data feed is managed 
  through a service which may emit various types of events. The key
  aspect of an event is defining a template to summarize an event
  frame into a short narrative (see 'nut graf').</li>

    <li>Installing the service profile on datawi.re. At the moment, there 
  is no user interface or API for installing a service - so please 
  [get in touch] so that we can set up your service for you. An
  interface will be available in future releases of datawi.re, but
  services will remain curated for legal, security and quality control
  reasons.</li>
</ul>

prefer open data and public domain sources where they are available.</p>
