<h2>What is datawi.re?</h2>

Yeah, good question.

<h3>Limits of datawi.re</h3>

<p>By design, datawi.re is a streaming service - not a data catalogue
or data warehouse system. This means that some functions you will be 
used to from databases are hard to produce with this approach.</p>

<p>In particular, datawi.re does not support summary statistics and 
aggregates - such as rankings and pivot tables - based on the data we 
process. It may be possible to implement such functionality through
plugins, but this will most likely not become a core component of
the site.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>We'd like to thank Lucy Chambers, Gregor Aisch, Nicola Hughes and
Rufus Pollock for their feedback on the concept and prototypes of 
datawi.re. Special thanks to Adam Thomas for coming up with the 
great name.</p>

<p>Further acknowledgements go to the developers of AngularJS, Flask,
Python, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL for the components used
in this system.</p>
